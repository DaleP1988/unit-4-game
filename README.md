## **How to Play Crystals Collector:**

At the beginning of the game, the player is given a random number. The player is instructed to select from 1 of the 4 Crystals Cards in the middle of the page. Each of these Crystals Cards are also assigned random numbers at the start of the game. Each time the player clicks on a card, the number from the previously selected Crystal (or Crystals) is added to the number assigned to the next selected Crystal. If the player reaches the correct total, which is the random number they were assigned at the beginning of the game, they win! If their total surpasses the random number they are assigned, they lose and the game ends.
